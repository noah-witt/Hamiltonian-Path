1. You have a 10 by 10 grid.
2. You can start at any spot on the grid.
3. You must land at each space exactly once.
4. you can move 8 directions. The first 4 our up, down, left, and right exactly parallel and perpendicular to the x and y axis of the graph. On those moves you skip 2 spaces, landing in the third space. The other 4 moves are offset 45 degrees from the previous 4 skipping 1 square while moving sideways.
